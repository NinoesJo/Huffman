# Huffman
mplement Huffman Coding for compression and decompression by building a HuffProcessor class. Begin with decompression, reading a magic number and traversing the Huffman tree to decode bits. For compression, create frequency tables, a Huffman tree, and bit encodings for each 8-bit chunk. Test using diff to verify file integrity.
